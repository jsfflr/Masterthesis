  abstract    = {API Design Patterns lays out a set of design principles for building internal and public-facing APIs.A collection of best practices and design standards for web and internal APIs.  In API Design Patterns you will learn:  Guiding principles for API patterns Fundamentals of resource layout and naming Handling data types for any programming language Standard methods that ensure predictability Field masks for targeted partial updates Authentication and validation methods for secure APIs Collective operations for moving, managing, and deleting data Advanced patterns for special interactions and data transformations  API Design Patterns reveals best practices for building stable, user-friendly APIs. These design patterns can be applied to solve common API problems and flexibly altered to fit your specific needs. Hands-on examples and relevant use-cases illustrate patterns for API fundamentals, advanced functionalities, and even uncommon scenarios.  Foreword by Jon Skeet.  Purchase of the print book includes a free eBook in PDF, Kindle, and ePub formats from Manning Publications.  About the technology  APIs are contracts that define how applications, services, and components communicate. API design patterns provide a shared set of best practices, specifications and standards that ensure APIs are reliable and simple for other developers to use. This book collects and explains the most important patterns from both the API design community and the experts at Google.  About the book  API Design Patterns lays out a set of design principles for building internal and public-facing APIs. Google API expert JJ Geewax presents patterns that ensure your APIs are consistent, scalable, and flexible. You'll improve the design of the most common APIs, plus discover techniques for tricky edge cases. Precise illustrations, relevant examples, and detailed scenarios make every pattern clear and easy to understand.  What's inside  Guiding principles for API patterns Fundamentals of resource layout and naming Advanced patterns for special interactions and data transformations A detailed case-study on building an API and adding features  About the reader  For developers building web and internal APIs in any language.  About the author  JJ Geewax is a software engineer at Google, focusing on Google Cloud Platform, API design, and real-time payment systems. He is also the author of Manning's Google Cloud Platform in Action.

  abstract  = {In the past few years, the OpenAPI Specification (OAS) has emerged as a standard description language for accurately modeling Web APIs. Today, thousands of OpenAPI descriptions can be found by mining open source repositories. In this paper, we attempt to exploit these artifacts to extract commonly occurring building blocks used in Web API structures, in order to assist Web API designers in their modelling task. Our work is based on a fragmentation mechanism, that starts from OpenAPI descriptions of Web APIs to extract their structures, then fragment these structures into smaller blocks. This approach enabled us to extract a large dataset of reoccurring fragments from a collection of 6619 API specifications. Such fragments have been found multiple times in the same or across different APIs. We have classified the most reoccurring fragments into four pattern primitives used to expose in the API access to collections of items. We distinguish for each primitive variants from design smells. This classification is based on the specific combinations of operations associated with the collection items and on an in-depth analysis of their natural language labels and descriptions. The resulting pattern primitives are intended to support designers who would like to introduce one or more collections for a specific class of items in their HTTP-based API.},
